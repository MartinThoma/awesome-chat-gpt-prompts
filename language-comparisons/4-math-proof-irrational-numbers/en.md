To prove the existence of irrational numbers, we must first define what they are. An irrational number is a real number that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers. In other words, it is a number that cannot be written in the form of p/q where p and q are integers and q is not equal to zero. Examples of irrational numbers include the square root of 2, pi, and e.

To prove the existence of irrational numbers, we will use a proof by contradiction. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that all real numbers can be expressed as a ratio of two integers. In other words, every real number is either rational or integer.

Let us consider the set S of all positive real numbers for which there exists an integer n such that n^2 is less than or equal to s and (n+1)^2 is greater than s. This set contains all positive integers and some non-integer positive real numbers.

Suppose that s is an element of S but is not an integer. Then, s must be irrational because if it were rational, we could write s as a ratio of two integers p and q such that p/q is in lowest terms. Then, we can write s as (p^2)/(q^2), which means that q^2 s = p^2. Since p^2 is a perfect square, it follows that p is also an integer.

Now, we can rewrite s as (p/q)^2. Since p and q are both integers and p/q is in lowest terms, it follows that p/q is not an integer. Therefore, s is an element of S that is not an integer, contradicting the assumption that all elements of S are either integers or rational numbers.

Thus, our assumption that all real numbers can be expressed as a ratio of two integers must be false. Therefore, there exist real numbers that are irrational and cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers.
